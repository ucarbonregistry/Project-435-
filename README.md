Applied methodologies and standardized
baselines

Applied Baseline Methodology:
AMS-I.D : “Grid connected renewable electricity
generation”, version 18

Standardized Methodology: Not Applicable.

Sectoral scopes 01 Energy industries
(Renewable/Non-Renewable Sources)

Estimated amount of total GHG emission
reductions
To be estimated during verification
[An ex-ante estimate is 1776 CoUs per year]

As per the approved consolidated methodology AMS-I.D. Version 18, if the project activity is the
installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant/unit, the baseline scenario is the following:
“The baseline scenario is that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have
otherwise, been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new
generation sources into the grid”.
